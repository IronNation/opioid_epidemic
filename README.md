# opioid_epidemic 
This project attempted to show the impact of the opioid epidemic. We found it very difficult to find that data that at the local level but also data that was recent. We did 2 Data sets that we could use. 

1. Motality rates due to drug overdose by state 
2. Rates of presciption pain killer drug by state. 
We attempted to gather both pieces of data and visualize the data using a heat map to show the impact of mortality rates due to drug overdose and rates of prescription pain killer drug by state throughout the country. 

As mentioned above, we ran into issues with finding data as well as team members to build the actual webapp. 

It was an eye opening experience especially to find that Data is hard to find with something that affects so many people in our country. I would like to continue this project, after hackathon as it is a very important issue that affects so many.
